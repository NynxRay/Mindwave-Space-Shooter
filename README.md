# Mindwave-Space-Shooter ( Old)
Our project can control game action by mind wave using the neurosky headset. The game we use is Space Shooter. 

Playing video games can boost creativity, improve problem-solving skills, and cultivate teamwork. People with disabilities, however, have limited opportunities to enjoy video games: those with visual challenges may not be able to participate in games that are rich in graphics, and those with mobility challenges may not be able to use a standard game controller. Our first motivation is to Make it convenient for people with disabilities to play games. Around 92% people with impairments play games despite difficulties. The ultimate goal is to Increase video game accessibility for disabilities.

We were trying to control game action by mind wave using the neurosky headset. The game we use is Space Shooter. Controlling game actions using keyboard is more efficient, but it might need wrist flexibility, hand-eye coordination, and speed. Therefore, if we can have actions or movements done as result of our thought, specifically our mind wave, even people who are not good at playing games can find it interesting and definitely want to give it a go. Our secon motivation is Using innovative way to play existing games and Improve hand-brain cooperation. Alternatively, Explore the possibility of game play using BCI
